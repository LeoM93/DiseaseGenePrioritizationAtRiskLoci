## Algorithm Description

In this work, we propose the Relations-Maximization Method, or RMM-GWAS. It leverages co-regulatory networks and biological annotations to identify a functional set of genes likely to be associated with a complex disease’s risk loci. Our method builds on the hypothesis that disease-relevant genes across GWAS loci share biological processes, pathways, and correlated gene expression levels. For this reason, it integrates network topology and gene biological information to derive a weighted co-regulatory network. Then, given a complex disease with multiple associated risk loci, our method prioritizes a set of genes, one per disease locus, so that the overall number of co-regulatory interactions, each weighted by the number of shared biological annotations, is maximized. The predicted set of genes i) covers the set of disease loci and ii) forms a set of genes that, on average, share many co-regulatory interactions.
